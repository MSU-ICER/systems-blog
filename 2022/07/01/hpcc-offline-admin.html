The HPCC is currently down due to a hardware failure and a failed failover. We are currently working with NetApp to resolve the issue. Users may have seen issues as soon as 2 PM, and the system has been fully down since about 3:30 PM.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: At about 5:30PM we’ve cleared the error on the NetApp and are working to restore HPCC services.</p>
