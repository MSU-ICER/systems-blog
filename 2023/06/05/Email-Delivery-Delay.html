<p>We are currently seeing performance issues with one of the University’s third-party email providers. This issue is impacting email delivery to ICER, including contact form requests and responses to incident tickets. If you receive a bounceback error message upon emailing ICER, know that delivery for your message may be delayed, but delivery will be re-attempted for up to 5 days. We will post an update as soon as this issue is resolved.</p>
