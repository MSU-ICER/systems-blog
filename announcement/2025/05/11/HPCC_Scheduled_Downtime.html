    <p><strong>Update 4:00 PM 5/12</strong> - Current status:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Work is progressing on restoring scratch (gs21) to service. We have successfully started all nodes and are working on rescanning the file system to bring it back online. We will update the status again tomorrow morning.</li>
  <li>Users may notice long pauses when accessing their home directory or research spaces on gateways or OpenOnDemand due to the offsite resynchronization process. We are investigating the cause of the delays. Home directories that have been migrated to ffs24 should not be delayed on compute nodes.</li>
  <li>We have reverted the upgrade of the RT server due to database issues. If you submitted a ticket between Friday morning and this afternoon, we will recreate the ticket, possibly with a new ticket ID number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Update 9:00AM 5/12 - To minimize the impact of the scratch outage, queued jobs referencing “gs21”, “scratch”, or “SCRATCH”, have been placed in a held state. This will show as the status “JobHeldUser”. If you have a job in this state that should be able to run without scratch, this hold can be released by running ‘scontrol release <jobid>'. These holds will be released when scratch is restored.</jobid></p>

<p>Update 4:00PM 5/11 - HPCC is back online.  HPCC is working with our vendor to recover gs21 scratch space.  It suffered some problems during the earlier power and generator testing.  The cluster is being returned to production without /mnt/scratch.  We will provide updates as we work through with our vendor.</p>

<p>Update 7:30PM 5/10 - ITS completed generator testing in the data center.  HPCC is still waiting on our provider to complete firewall updates, which would cause significant downtime during that process.  We are waiting on that before migrating back to production.</p>

<p>Update 11:00am 5/9 - HPCC has completed routine maintenance.  ITS was not able to complete the water cooling tests and those will need to be completed some day in the future.  Unfortunately we will remain down for the ITS data center power and generator testing on Saturday.  Their work is expected to be completed by 4:00PM on Saturday followed by us turning everything back on.</p>

<p>Update 8:17am 5/9 - HPCC is in maintenance mode until Saturday evening.  You cannot login or run jobs until then.  Blog will be updated accordingly as time goes on.</p>

<p>The HPCC will be unavailable on Friday, May 9th and Saturday, May 10th, 2025 for our regularly scheduled maintenance and IPF required power system testing. No jobs will run during this time and logins to gateway nodes will be disabled. Jobs that will not be completed before May 9th will not begin until after maintenance is complete. For example, if you submit a four day job three days before the maintenance outage, your job will be postponed and will not begin to run until after maintenance is completed. Jobs and logins will be resumed once the maintenance is complete.</p>
