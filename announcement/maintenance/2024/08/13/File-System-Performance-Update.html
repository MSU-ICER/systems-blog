    <p>UPDATE: 8/20/2024 - All maintenance processes requested by our vendor have completed and home and research file system performance should be returned to normal. Today we will be replacing some hardware as requested by our vendor, but there will be no impact to performance. We will begin attempting to migrate data to the new file system tomorrow morning with our vendor and will provide another update tomorrow as well. Disaster recovery snapshots will remain disabled throughout today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 8/19/2024 PM - We are experiencing filesystem slowdowns, which are affecting OnDemand, Globus, and other services. We are working to mitigate this.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 8/19/2024 AM - We have temporarily disabled disaster recovery snapshots as we continue to work with our vendor to prepare to move data to our new home and research file system. We will provide another update as our work continues and once snapshots are re-enabled.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 8/16/2024 - Disaster recovery snapshots have now been restarted for all filesets on the home and research file systems. The impact of these snapshot processes on performance should now be greatly reduced; however, other maintenance tasks will continue to run over the weekend, which could be noticed as small, intermittent performance slow downs.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 8/16/2024 - Disaster recovery snapshots are restarting today to allow disaster recovery to update over the weekend. Intermittent performance slow downs on home and research file systems may occur while updated disaster recovery snapshots are taken. We will provide another update on Monday, 8/19/2024.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 8/15/2024 - We are currently working with our vendor to resume moving data to our new file system. We have temporarily disabled disaster recovery snapshots while we work through this process. We will provide another update as our work continues and once snapshots are re-enabled.</p>

<p>As we continue our efforts to improve the HPCC file systems and user experience, we are taking additional steps to ensure the home and research file systems have fully recovered from the outage that occurred this past May and proceed with the migration to the new home directory and research hardware.</p>

<p>Beginning on August 14, additional steps will be taken that require us to intermittently stop disaster recovery replication. This means that if you delete or modify files in home and research spaces while disaster recovery replication is disabled, we may not be able to recover changes made while replication is disabled. Home file system performance may also be impacted throughout this time.</p>

<p>Because disaster recovery replication will be intermittent, you can choose to copy your data into your scratch space if you would like to maintain additional, temporary copies. While the scratch data is deleted every 45 days, we plan to have disaster recovery backups running normally before then. The scratch space will not be affected by the home system migration.</p>

<p>This blog post will continue to be updated until the filesystem upgrade project is completed.</p>
