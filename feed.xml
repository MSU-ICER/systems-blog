        <title>Project verification process complete</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all PIs who have verified their existing projects and users on the HPCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PIs with existing projects that have not verified those projects have had their account and all of their sponsored users’ accounts deactivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, we will be asking users and PIs without projects to ensure that they create or are added to a project to align with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/ICER_User_and_Data_Policies/&quot;&gt;ICER’s User and Data Policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>File system down</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Update: 1/26 6 PM. The research filesystem has been restored to service. Users may experience intermittent delays while backup processes are restarted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research space file system has been unresponsive since 8PM on 1/27/2026. This may cause issues with logins via SSH and OnDemand and jobs may fail. ICER is working with the storage vendor to resolve the issue. Updates will be posted here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Network Issues</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: External connectivity has been restored to rsync and Globus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: All failed network hardware that caused yesterday’s outage has been replaced. Rsync and globus access from non-Internet2 sites are not available as of 7 PM, 1/20/2026, due to a routing configuration change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During network maintenance, a core Ethernet switch had a hardware failure at 2:01 PM. During this window, access to all external HPCC services (gateways, dev nodes, OOD, Contact) were interrupted. Service was restored by 2:20. ICER and ITS have identified failed hardware and working to replace the failed component tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you notice additional problems, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Research Space File System Issues - UPDATED 1/27/2026</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UPDATE - 1/27/2026 4:15PM - We are continuing maintenance on the research file system to maintain reliability and performance, and will be running several processes after 6PM each night this week to prepare for an upcoming upgrade to this file system. Users may notice some delays during this maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, 12/06/2025, a brief outage occurred on the file system hosting research spaces. This outage reoccurred on Monday, 12/08/2025. To mitigate impacts to our users and their running jobs, we disabled some features on the file system at that time. Beginning Thursday, 12/11/2025, we began reenabling all file system features. Due to the work on Thursday, 12/11, periodic slowdowns and pauses on the file system have been reported. We are aware of this issue, and are actively working with our vendor to resolve these slowdowns and pauses as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Slurm Database Outage at 10:00AM on 12/15/25 - RESOLVED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED: At 11:30AM, the Slurm database upgrade completed without issue. The database is now back online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, December 15th, at 10:00AM, the SLURM database will go offline to undergo a major Slurm version update. The database is expected to be offline through the upcoming downtime. During this outage, the sacct client command will be unavailable for querying job information and job queue time estimations will not be updated. Other client commands (e.g. squeue, srun, sbatch, salloc) will continue to work as expected. Jobs may still be submitted and will start normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this outage or you experience issues following this outage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AMD24 Downtime to Fix Small Leak in Liquid Cooling Pipe - RESOLVED 12/10/2025</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 12/10/2025 - Repairs were completed earlier than expected.  Everything is back online.  Please contact us if you notice anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 12/5/2025 - Our water cooling vendor scheduled the repairs for Wed, 12/10/2025, first thing in the morning.  Jobs on AMD24 will be killed shortly after the repairs start.  The repairs will take 14-18 hours, during which AMD24 will remain offline. We will continue to monitor the cooling systems closely until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the repair of ICER’s liquid cooling pumps, we detected a small leak in the piping. This leak does not endanger ICER’s equipment, but we need to do an emergency repair that requires us to take the AMD24 cluster down for approximately 14 to 18 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the repair parts are currently in transit, we do not yet have specific details about the maintenance. We have been told it will be early next week. AMD24 will need to be shut down for one to two days. We will update this blog with specifics as we gather more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please contact us using our &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
