        <title>Gateway Node Operating System Upgrades - UPDATE 8/20/2025</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: 8/20/2025 - As of 8/21/2025, MobaXterm version v22.0 or later will be required to access the HPCC.  MobaXterm users should update to the latest version or ensure they are using at least version v22.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday 08/21/2025 at 6:00 PM, we will be upgrading the operating systems on our gateway nodes. Users will see an alert notification in their terminal before the system is shut down to allow users sufficient time to save their work.  If you experience a timeout while attempting to connect to the HPCC, please try again after a short (3-5 min) delay or use our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ondemand.hpcc.msu.edu&quot;&gt;open ondemand instance&lt;/a&gt;. If you continue to have difficulty logging into HPCC resources or notice any new issues with your connection to the HPCC, please let us know by submitting a ticket through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact&quot;&gt;Contact Forms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gateway Configuration Updates - 8/15/2025</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of our efforts to improve security, we will be making some changes to the configuration of our gateway nodes on Monday August 18th, 2025. Initially, these changes will only affect a single gateway node (gateway-00.hpcc.msu.edu), but eventually all gateway nodes will have the updated configuration. If you experience an error in connecting to the hpcc after Monday, you may need to update your ssh client. As always, please submit a &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu&quot;&gt;ticket&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions or experience an ongoing issue connecting to the HPCC.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Intel16 Cluster Has Been Retired</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;All intel16 nodes have been retired and removed from the cluster configuration. This includes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lac&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; nodes, as well as all &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;k80&lt;/code&gt; GPUs. Buy-in accounts that contained only &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;intel16&lt;/code&gt; nodes have been disabled and members’ default accounts updated to other buy-ins or to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;general&lt;/code&gt; account. If you have any questions about this change or encounter any issues, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OnDemand Portal Offline - RESOLVED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED 8/8: The OnDemand portal is available again and mounting the GPFS filesystem properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OnDemand portal is currently unavailable. Following the OnDemand server’s migration to new underlying compute hardware, the GPFS filesystem failed to mount properly, preventing the portal from coming online. We are currently working to resolve this issue as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Brief Slurm Outage on Thursday 8/7 - RESOLVED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED 8:30PM: The Slurm controller and database servers are back online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 8:15PM on Thursday, August 7th, ICER’s Slurm scheduling and database servers will go offline to undergo a brief migration to new hardware. This migration is expected to take less than 15 minutes. During this time, new jobs may not be queued and no new jobs will start. Running jobs will be unaffected. Client commands (e.g. sacct, squeue, sbatch) will be unavailable during the migration. If you have any questions about this migration or encounter any issues with Slurm servers following the update, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gateway Node Reboots - August 5 to 8, 2025</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginning the evening of August 5, ICER will be rebooting each of our gateway nodes to upgrade the infrastructure powering the gateways. These reboots are expected to take 10 minutes each, and will be completed each day at 6PM based on the schedule below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First gateway  8/5/2025 @6pm
Second gateway 8/6/2025 @6pm
Third gateway  8/7/2025 @6pm
Fourth gateway 8/8/2025 @6pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users will be alerted before each reboot. If you get a connection timeout when trying to connect to the HPCC through ssh, please wait a few minutes and try again.  If you have continued issues connecting, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;open a ticket&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>Slurm Database Outage at 8:00PM on 7/29/25 - RESOLVED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED: The Slurm database server is back online&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, July 29th, at 8:00PM, the Slurm database will go offline in order to allocate more memory to the host server. This is being done to improve overall server stability and responsiveness. The database is expected to be offline for approximately 30 minutes. During this outage, the sacct and sacctmgr commands will be unavailable, as will managing buy-in account memberships through the buyin_status powertool. Other client commands (e.g. squeue, srun, sbatch, salloc) will continue to work as expected. Jobs may still be submitted and will start normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this outage or you experience issues following this outage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
