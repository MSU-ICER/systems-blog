        <title>HPCC offline - resolved</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The HPCC is currently down due to a hardware failure and a failed failover. We are currently working with NetApp to resolve the issue. Users may have seen issues as soon as 2 PM, and the system has been fully down since about 3:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: At about 5:30PM weâ€™ve cleared the error on the NetApp and are working to restore HPCC services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: As of 7:30 PM services have been restored to service. &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu&quot;&gt;Please let us know if you have any issues.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Scratch gs21 availability and gs18/ls15 retirement - UPDATED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce the general release of our new gs21 scratch system, now available at /mnt/gs21/scratch on all user systems, including gateways, development nodes, and the compute cluster. The new scratch system provides 3 PB of space for researchers and allows us to continue to maintain 50 TB quotas for our growing community. The new system also includes 200 TB of high-speed flash. You may begin to utilize the new scratch system immediately. Please read on for more information about the transition to this space.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 1st, /mnt/scratch and the $SCRATCH variable will be updated to point to the new gs21 space. On July 15th, ls15 and gs18 will be marked read-only, and will be removed from service on July 31st. Please update your scripts or programs that explicitly use gs18 and ls15 to use gs21. If you have a large quantity of data (&amp;gt;10 TB) to move from the old systems to the new, please contact us and we can help you use tools to transfer the data quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the high utilization of gs18 and the age of ls15 and gs18, we are encouraging users to begin migrating to gs21 at their earliest convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to a number of circumstances, the $SCRATCH environment variable will be updated on Friday, July 15, 2022. ls15/gs18 will be marked read-only on July 22, 2022 and removed from service on July 31, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
