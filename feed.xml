        <title>Some GPU Jobs Affected by Scheduler Bug</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An update last Thursday introduced a bug into our scheduling logic that was present through yesterday afternoon. This bug affected GPU jobs submitted with certain types of constraints. The bug resulted in these jobs getting a constraint that differed from that which was requested, potentially running them on incompatible hardware. All GPU and CPU hours consumed by these affected jobs have been refunded. We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Intel 18 limited availability</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Intel 18 cluster, both general and buy-in nodes, will have limited availability starting the end of next week with limited to no availability the week starting Feb 10th.  The downtime is part of a rearrangement plan with bringing water cooling into the data center for the new cluster.  Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; if this does not work for you and we can temporarily move you to a different buy-in node.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OnDemand Server Reboot - RESOLVED 1/22/25</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED: 1/22/2025 - Our OnDemand server has been successfully rebooted and is back online with more memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 8PM on Wednesday 1/22/2025, we will be rebooting our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ondemand.hpcc.msu.edu&quot;&gt;OnDemand server&lt;/a&gt;. This reboot is necessary to allocate more memory to the server in an effort to improve system stability. We estimate the server will be offline for no more than 15 minutes. If you have any questions, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Transition to a new homedir</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ICER is migrating to a new HPCC home directory system called VAST, an all flash system that will enable fast access to files in your home spaces, and a significantly better working environment overall. Along with the migration, we are increasing the default home space size from 50 GB to 100 GB which will be a hard limit going forward to ensure that usage of home spaces is aligned with their intended purpose (home space documentation). To help accommodate these changes, we are increasing the maximum free research space per principal investigator from 1TB to 3TB. This move toward more research space storage will also enhance collaboration amongst your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of moving all HPCC home directories to the new VAST system will be spread over time. Starting the week of January 20th, we will start the process of migrating users with less than 100GB of home directory usage to the VAST storage. This will require no HPCC usage during the migration, including scheduled jobs and interactive sessions. We will send users an individual notification ahead of time when their migration is scheduled to start and when their migration starts. Once the move to VAST is complete, they will again be notified and will automatically use the VAST system on their next login.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already using less than 100GB of home space or you can get your usage below this limit before January 15th, you will be among the initial group of users migrated to the VAST system. We will reach out to users above 100GB with further tools and processes later this semester. These users will receive a usage report showing their home directory usage. PIs will also receive team and research group usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you or your team need extra help with this change or want to opt out of the initial migration group, please reach out to the ICER team by opening a ticket in the following website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;Contact Form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Home_Migration/&quot;&gt;ICER Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your patience during this transition.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Minor SLURM Update - RESOLVED 1/9/2025</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED: 1/9/2025 - All nodes are back online. Users affected by job failures will be contacted and refunded any used CPU or GPU hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: 1/9/2025 - In the process of updating SLURM, a compatibility issue has taken many nodes offline and caused about 400 jobs to fail during a change of job step. Running jobs do not appear to be affected as of now. We are working to resolve this issue and bring nodes back online. If you have any questions about this update or you are experience issues, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, January 9th, we will be deploying a minor update to the SLURM scheduling software. This update includes bug fixes to improve system stability. Running and queued jobs should not be affected. No interruptions are expected to client command functionality (e.g. squeue, sbatch, sacct). If you have any questions about this update or you experience issues following this update, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED: All login gateways are now active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are aware of login issues with SSH. These are caused by an outage of a single login gateway. We are working to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workaround: connect via our OnDemand portal at https://ondemand.hpcc.msu.edu/&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HPCC Scheduled Downtime - RESOLVED 12/19/2024</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED: Maintenance is complete, thank you for your patience. Job submissions will continue to run after 5PM on 12/19. Please note that as the intel14 cluster has been retired, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;intel14&lt;/code&gt; constraint must be removed from any jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HPCC will be unavailable on Thursday, December 19th for our regularly scheduled maintenance.  No jobs will run during this time. Jobs that will not be completed before December 19th will not begin until after maintenance is complete. For example, if you submit a four day job three days before the maintenance outage, your job will be postponed and will not begin to run until after maintenance is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High level overview of changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gateways host keys replacement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cluster OS updates to improve stability and security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firmware and driver upgrades&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final GPFS updates for summer storage replacement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slurm upgrade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network upgrades for new cluster&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bug fixes and other improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Intel16 Cluster Currently Offline - RESOLVED 11/19/2024</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED: 11/19/2024 12:10PM - On 11/18/2024 ITS performed maintenance on a number of switches in the data center that required rebooting critical network infrastructure. After these reboots, several links connecting to the intel16 cluster did not recover. During this time, you may have also noticed brief pauses in OnDemand and on Gateway nodes. This morning we were able to work with ITS to re-establish connectivity to all intel16 nodes, and the intel16 cluster, along with all other nodes, are now back in production and running jobs via Slurm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 8:40pm on 11/18/2024 the intel16 cluster went offline due to a network outage and remains offline. Currently no jobs requesting to run on intel16 will be scheduled. We are troubleshooting this network outage with IT Services and will provide more information when it is available via an update to this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
