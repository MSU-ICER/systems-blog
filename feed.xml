        <title>Server Maintenance on June 22 at 5:30AM</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are currently experiencing issues with a server that hosts one of the HPCC gateway nodes, along with a few other HPCC services. Between 5:30AM and 6:15AM on June 22, 2023, this server will be rebooted. The HPCC will still be accessible during this time via one of our other gateways, although you may receive a time-out while the server is rebooted. If you receive a connection time-out during this time while attempting to connect to the HPCC, please continue trying to connect until you are redirected to a still active gateway node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An update will be posted here when service is 100% restored.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Email Delivery Delays - June 5, 2023 - UPDATED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Email to ICER is now functioning again without errors or delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently seeing performance issues with one of the University’s third-party email providers. This issue is impacting email delivery to ICER, including contact form requests and responses to incident tickets. If you receive a bounceback error message upon emailing ICER, know that delivery for your message may be delayed, but delivery will be re-attempted for up to 5 days. We will post an update as soon as this issue is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scheduled Home Filesystem Update - Tuesday, May 30, 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, May 30th at 10am EDT, we will be performing a minor version upgrade of our home filesystem. This process will take approximately two hours. While we will be performing the update with the filesystem online, there is a possibility that the cluster may briefly lose connection to the storage. Please take this into consideration for any jobs which will be running during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about these updates or you experience issues following these updates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Local File Quotas Are Now Set for /tmp and /var on All Nodes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginning May 3, 2023, user quotas will be in place on all nodes for the /tmp and /var directories. All user accounts will be limited to 95% of the total /tmp partition space that is available on a particular node, and a 5GB limit on the /var partition. If a user account exceeds this quota, a 2 hour grace period will be allowed before the user account is no longer able to write to the /tmp or /var directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about these changes &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Intel14 Nodes Now Dedicated to OnDemand</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Intel14 nodes have been removed from general queues and repurposed. A combined total of 2468 CPU cores and 15.66TB of memory has been dedicated to running jobs submitted through ICER’s installation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Open_OnDemand&quot;&gt;Open OnDemand&lt;/a&gt;. Dedicating these resources will help to reduce the amount of time users have to wait to launch interactive jobs through OnDemand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about these changes or you experience any issues using OnDemand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SLURM Node Updates on Thursday, March 30th</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, March 30th, at 10:00AM, SLURM clients will be updated to the latest version. This update will bring the node and user components of SLURM to the same version as our SLURM controller and database. Most client commands (e.g. squeue, sbatch, sacct) should work seemlessly through this update. New jobs can be queued as normal and running jobs should not be affected. During these updates, nodes will appear as offline and no new jobs will start. Please note that pending srun/salloc commands may fail to start after this update is complete. If you have a job submitted through srun/salloc that fails after this update, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;. We can boost the priority of your job after resubmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about these updates or you experience issues following these updates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
