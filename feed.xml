        <title>New Limits on Scavenger Queue</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have implemented a new limit of 520 running jobs per user and 1000 submitted jobs per user in the scavenger queue. We have put this limit in place ensure that the scheduler is able to evaluate all the jobs in the queue during its regular scheduling cycles. This matches our general queue limits. Please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu&quot;&gt;our documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information about our &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/job_policies/&quot;&gt;scheduler policy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Scavenger_Queue/&quot;&gt;scavenger queue&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any questions regarding this change, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Resolved: Ondemand failing when job is scheduled on a new acm node.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOVLED 10/14/2022: OnDemand Desktop works on the amd22 cluster now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 10/13/2022:  The OnDemand application has been updated to prevent jobs from running on the acm nodes.  You can select the “any” option (which typically queues the fastest) and the system will now select from intel14, intel16, intel 18 and amd20 compute nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users are reporting intermittent problems with interactive ondemand jobs.  We have tracked the problem down to the jobs failing when they are scheduled on one of the new acm nodes.  We are in the process of isolating the source of the failure. Users will see a “connecting” message&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Connecting.png&quot; alt=&quot;VNC Connecting screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then the job will fail to start with a screen similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Failed.png&quot; alt=&quot;VNC failure to launch screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can avoid the problem by checking the “Advanced Options” checkbox and then selecting a “Node type” other than “any” (“amd20” is a good choice). This will force the interactive desktop to use one of the working architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Pick_node.png&quot; alt=&quot;Picking anything but any&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Service availability issues 10/10</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At about 12:20 PM on October 10th, a bad git merge for our configuration management software caused old configurations to get pushed out to all nodes, which broke a number of services (including the contact forms and job submission on some nodes.) This was reverted by 1:08 PM, but due to caching some nodes may have received this configuration through 2 PM. All nodes and services should be back to normal functionality by 3 PM on October 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
