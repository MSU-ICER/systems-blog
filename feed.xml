        <title>SLURM Database Outage at 10:00AM on 3/9/23 - UPDATED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/em&gt; The database upgrade is complete. The sacct command will now function as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/em&gt; The database upgrade is taking longer than anticipated. The sacct command will continue to be unavailable as the upgrade progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, March 9th, at 10:00AM, the SLURM database will go offline to undergo an upgrade to the latest software release. The database is expected to be offline for approximately two hours. During this time, the sacct client command will be unavailable for querying job information. Other client commands (e.g. squeue, srun, sbatch, salloc) will continue to work as expected. Jobs may still be submitted and will start normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this outage or you experience issues following this outage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scratch purge of 45 day old files</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting on February 15th, files on /mnt/scratch (/mnt/gs21) that have not been modified within the last 45 days will be deleted. Due to technical issues, this purge has not been running and older files have not been regularly removed from scratch/gs21. This issue has been fixed and automatic deletion will resume on February 15th. Users should ensure that any data older than 45 days on scratch/gs21 that they wish to save has been moved to persistent storage (home/research spaces or external storage.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not impact home directories or research spaces. As a reminder, scratch space is not backed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details can be found on https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Scratch_File_Systems/&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HPCC Scheduled Downtime</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Update 1/5/2023
All updates were completed by 3pm on 1/4/2023.  Globus had problems and was brought back online 1/5/2023.
If you experience any problems, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes include system updates and new kernel “3.10.0-1160.80.1.el7.x86_64” for all compute cluster nodes, gateways, rsync, and globus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HPCC will be unavailable on Wednesday, January 4th for our regularly scheduled maintenance.  No jobs will run during this time. Jobs that will not be completed before January 4th will not begin until after maintenance is complete. For example, if you submit a four day job three days before the maintenance outage, your job will be postponed and will not begin to run until after maintenance is completed.
If you have any questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Limits on Scavenger Queue</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have implemented a new limit of 520 running jobs per user and 1000 submitted jobs per user in the scavenger queue. We have put this limit in place ensure that the scheduler is able to evaluate all the jobs in the queue during its regular scheduling cycles. This matches our general queue limits. Please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu&quot;&gt;our documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information about our &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/job_policies/&quot;&gt;scheduler policy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Scavenger_Queue/&quot;&gt;scavenger queue&lt;/a&gt;.
