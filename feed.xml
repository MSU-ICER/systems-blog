        <title>Update to FairShare Priority Calculation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have have updated scheduler parameters that determine how users’ recent cluster usage affects their FairShare priority factor. Previously, memory usage was weighted higher than CPU usage and GPU usage was not considered. Now, CPU, memory, and GPU usage are all considered in the calculation of FairShare priority and weighted in proportion to the overall availability of those resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information about this change can be found in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/How_Jobs_are_Scheduled/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this change, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Network errors - Problems connecting to HPCC - RESOLVED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED: 11/10/2025 8:00AM - The malfunctioning core network infrastructure has been successfully replaced and the ICER network is 100% operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: 3:00PM - We are working with ITS to install replacement network hardware to return our core network infrastructure to normal operation. Beginning at 6:30AM on Monday, November 10, we will begin bringing services back online using the new network infrastructure. Brief network interruptions may be seen during this time, but should resolve automatically without any outages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: 8:30AM - Impact is resolved.  We identified core network hardware that had failed in a way that prevented High Availability to function properly.  This hardware has been removed from production while we work to get it replaced.  Users shouldn’t notice an impact, but we will be without redundancy on the core network until it is replaced.  ITS is working with the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HPCC is experiencing network errors causing connection issues.  We are working with ITS networking team on a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HPCC Scheduled Downtime</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The HPCC will be unavailable on Thursday, December 18th for our regularly scheduled maintenance.  No jobs will run during this time. Jobs that will not be completed before December 19th will not begin until after maintenance is complete. For example, if you submit a four day job three days before the maintenance outage, your job will be postponed and will not begin to run until after maintenance is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Water Cooling Repairs for AMD24</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple steps are needed to repair the water pumps from our failure on 7/9.  This Wednesday, Oct 15th, our primary water cooling loop will be taken down for 8 hours.  We anticipate AMD24 will remain in a safe operating zone during that time.  We will monitor it closely.  If the machines reach a high temperature we will need to take them offline and cancel jobs.  If this happens, we will work with impacted users.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>UPDATED: Scratch Filesystem Errors and Timeouts - UPDATED 10/24/2025</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: 10/24/2025 3:41PM - The scratch filesystem is back online and all held jobs have been released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: 10/24/2025 - We were unable to hold some jobs that required scratch and those jobs failed as a result. We will reach out to the affected users to offer priority boosts on job resubmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: 10/14/2025 - The scratch filesystem will be offline on Friday, 10/24/2025 from 8AM to 5PM to resolve this hardware issue. We will attempt to place any job referencing the scratch filesystem on hold during this time. However, if you have a job failure related to this emergency maintenance, please let us know via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact&quot;&gt;Contact Form&lt;/a&gt;, and we can work with you to reschedule the job as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hardware issue is currently affecting the performance of the scratch filesystem on the HPCC. We are working with our vendor to resolve this issue. Scratch may need to be taken offline at some point in the next few weeks to resolve the error, and we will coordinate with users to ensure the least amount of disruption to workflows. More information on scheduled maintenance will be provided as soon as it is available. If you are currently experiencing issues reading or writing to the scratch filesystem, please let us know via our &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact&quot;&gt;Contact Form&lt;/a&gt;, and we can work with you on alternatives to support your workflow until this issue is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GPU Development Node Updates</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For system stability and better utilization of shared resources, today we are implementing an additional procedure on our GPU development nodes to ensure any long running GPU processes (greater than 2 hours) are automatically removed from the development node.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/development_nodes/&quot;&gt;For more information on our development nodes, please see our documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
