        <title>Old Home Directory Maintenance Beginning Monday 6/23/25</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Monday, June 23, 2025, we will begin consolidating all data remaining on the old home filesystem to make room for additional research space storage. While many of you who were moved to the new filesystem in the past several weeks still have access to this data, you should not be using the old home filesystem for any running jobs or active workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will continue to maintain access to your old home directory data throughout the summer, but may notice intermittent pauses in your access while the data is being consolidated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on the new home filesystem, please consult &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Home_Migration/&quot;&gt;our documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please contact us using our &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact&quot;&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Security Patch Applied on 6/19/25</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On 19 June, 2025 a security patch was applied to the system. Although no user impact is expected, please open a ticket using our contact page https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact if you encounter any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Home migration - RESOLVED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED: As of June 10th, 8:43AM, all users except those with running jobs have been migrated. Users with running jobs will be migrated when their jobs complete. Please see the details in this post for information on moving files to new research spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, June 10th, 2025, ICER will be moving all remaining user home directories to the new, more performant &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Home_Migration/&quot;&gt;home filesystem&lt;/a&gt;.
This primarily affects users that were using more than 100GB in their home directories as of March 28th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are part of this group, you will have received an email with details on Friday, June 6th, 2025.
In preparation for this move, on Monday June 9th, all affected users have had their SLURM jobs held to prevent failures during the migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When any remaining jobs have completed after Tuesday morning, affected users will be unable to login for a short period of time. During this time, any processes running on gateway or development nodes will stop, and any attempt to login via SSH will show a message like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your account has expired; please contact your system administrator
account expired 20248 days ago
Connection closed by server port 22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging in via OnDemand will also be unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The migration is anticipated to be complete by the afternoon on June 10th. If a user still has running jobs at this point, their migration will be delayed until their jobs complete. Afterwards, users will receive an email notification and can then continue using the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are moved to the new file system after June 10th and have not moved files in your old home directory to the new system, your new home directory will appear empty. You will need to move up to 100GB of files to your new home directory. Any files in excess of 100GB can be moved to research spaces as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For help with moving files, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Steps_to_Migrate_to_the_New_Home_System_Manually/&quot;&gt;the instructions in our documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Minor SLURM Update on 05/29/25</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, May 29th, we will be deploying a minor update to the SLURM scheduling software. This update patches a security vulnerability and will allow us to re-enable buy-in account coordinator functionality. Running and queued jobs should not be affected. A brief interruption to client commands may be experienced (e.g. squeue, sbatch, sacct). If you have any questions about this update or you experience issues following this update, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HPCC Scheduled Downtime - Resolved on 5/14/2025 5:30pm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 5:30 PM 5/14&lt;/strong&gt; - Current status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gs21 has been returned to service, and all held jobs have been released. We have some open issues to address with the vendor but the system should operate as expected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;research/ufs24 should be performing as normal. We are continuing to investigate to identify a root cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9 AM 5/14&lt;/strong&gt; - Current status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work on g21 / scratch with the vendor is continuing. We are checking the integrity of the system before returning to service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We identified what appeared to be a source of the problem last night with ufs24/research. We have not seen any pauses since removing it last night. We have an open ticket with the vendor to confirm the root causes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:15 PM 5/13&lt;/strong&gt; - Current status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have successfully attached the components of the scratch file system and are working with the vendor to scan and mount them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ongoing home pauses should be limited. We have repaired the network link but are still seeing some slow performance. We are working with the vendor to resolve the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SchedMD has identified the cause of the Slurm outage. We have removed the responsible component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:00 PM 5/13&lt;/strong&gt; - Current status&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are still working with the vendor for scratch (gs21); a component has failed in a way that is blocking the file system from mounting. The vendor is actively engaged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Home pauses / IO delays should be reduced as most of the active AFM resynchronization has completed. We have identified a network link that we are investigating as the cause.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affected RT tickets have been recreated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SchedMD has examined the Slurm issue and identified a potential cause; we have not seen a reoccurrence since.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:00 PM 5/12&lt;/strong&gt; - Current status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is progressing on restoring scratch (gs21) to service. We have successfully started all nodes and are working on rescanning the file system to bring it back online. We will update the status again tomorrow morning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users may notice long pauses when accessing their home directory or research spaces on gateways or OpenOnDemand due to the offsite resynchronization process. We are investigating the cause of the delays. Home directories that have been migrated to ffs24 should not be delayed on compute nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have reverted the upgrade of the RT server due to front-end compatibility issues. If you submitted a ticket between Friday morning and this afternoon, we will recreate the ticket, possibly with a new ticket ID number.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are tracking an issue with the Slurm server that may cause slurm commands like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;squeue&lt;/code&gt; to become unresponsive. We have contacted the vendor and are investigating diagnostic data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 9:00AM 5/12 - To minimize the impact of the scratch outage, queued jobs referencing “gs21”, “scratch”, or “SCRATCH”, have been placed in a held state. This will show as the status “JobHeldUser”. If you have a job in this state that should be able to run without scratch, this hold can be released by running ‘scontrol release &lt;jobid&gt;'. These holds will be released when scratch is restored.&lt;/jobid&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 4:00PM 5/11 - HPCC is back online.  HPCC is working with our vendor to recover gs21 scratch space.  It suffered some problems during the earlier power and generator testing.  The cluster is being returned to production without /mnt/scratch.  We will provide updates as we work through with our vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 7:30PM 5/10 - ITS completed generator testing in the data center.  HPCC is still waiting on our provider to complete firewall updates, which would cause significant downtime during that process.  We are waiting on that before migrating back to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 11:00am 5/9 - HPCC has completed routine maintenance.  ITS was not able to complete the water cooling tests and those will need to be completed some day in the future.  Unfortunately we will remain down for the ITS data center power and generator testing on Saturday.  Their work is expected to be completed by 4:00PM on Saturday followed by us turning everything back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 8:17am 5/9 - HPCC is in maintenance mode until Saturday evening.  You cannot login or run jobs until then.  Blog will be updated accordingly as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HPCC will be unavailable on Friday, May 9th and Saturday, May 10th, 2025 for our regularly scheduled maintenance and IPF required power system testing. No jobs will run during this time and logins to gateway nodes will be disabled. Jobs that will not be completed before May 9th will not begin until after maintenance is complete. For example, if you submit a four day job three days before the maintenance outage, your job will be postponed and will not begin to run until after maintenance is completed. Jobs and logins will be resumed once the maintenance is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SLURM Database Outage at 10:00AM on 5/8/25 - RESOLVED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED: The database upgrade completes without issue and the database is back online&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, May 8th, at 10:00AM, the SLURM database will go offline in preparation for an underlying operating system upgrade. The database is expected to be offline through the upcoming downtime. During this outage, the sacct client command will be unavailable for querying job information. Other client commands (e.g. squeue, srun, sbatch, salloc) will continue to work as expected. Jobs may still be submitted and will start normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this outage or you experience issues following this outage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gateway ssh host key updates - RESOLVED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: 4/17/2025 7:00 AM - Gateway node ssh host identification keys have been changed, please see documentation listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of ongoing system updates, our ssh gateway node host identification keys are changing.  Once these keys are changed, you will likely receive a warning that the host key has changed.  Please refer to our documentation for more details on ssh host keys and resolving this error (https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Resetting_Known_Hosts/).  You can find the most up to date list of ssh host keys in our documentation as well (https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Connect_to_HPCC_System/#current-ssh-host-identification-key-fingerprints).&lt;/p&gt;
