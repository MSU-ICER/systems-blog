        <title>Intel14 Nodes Now Dedicated to OnDemand</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Intel14 nodes have been removed from general queues and repurposed. A combined total of 2568 CPU cores and 15.9TB of memory has been dedicated to running jobs submitted through ICER’s installation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Open_OnDemand&quot;&gt;Open OnDemand&lt;/a&gt;. Dedicating these resources will help to reduce the amount of time users have to wait to launch interactive jobs through OnDemand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about these changes or you experience any issues using OnDemand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SLURM Node Updates on Thursday, March 30th</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, March 30th, at 10:00AM, SLURM clients will be updated to the latest version. This update will bring the node and user components of SLURM to the same version as our SLURM controller and database. Most client commands (e.g. squeue, sbatch, sacct) should work seemlessly through this update. New jobs can be queued as normal and running jobs should not be affected. During these updates, nodes will appear as offline and no new jobs will start. Please note that pending srun/salloc commands may fail to start after this update is complete. If you have a job submitted through srun/salloc that fails after this update, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;. We can boost the priority of your job after resubmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about these updates or you experience issues following these updates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Intel14 nodes to be removed from general queues - Updated</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/em&gt; Intel14 nodes have been removed from general queues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, March 21st, intel14 cluster nodes will be removed from the general queues and will no longer be available to run regular jobs. This removal is in preparation to dedicate intel14 hardware to exclusively serve interactive jobs submitted through &lt;a href=&quot;https://ondemand.hpcc.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;OnDemand&lt;/a&gt;. Users who have bought in to the intel14 cluster will still have access to their nodes outside of OnDemand through their regular buy-in accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this change or encounter issues following this change, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SLURM Scheduler Update at 5:00PM on 3/16/23 - Updated</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/em&gt; The scheduler is back online and functioning normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/em&gt; The scheduler encountered an error following the update and is currently offline. We are working with our software vendor to find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, March 16th, at 5:00PM, the SLURM scheduler will go offline to undergo an upgrade to the latest software release. The scheduler is expected to be offline for less than 30 minutes for this update. During this time, many SLURM client commands will be unavailable, including squeue, sbatch, srun, and salloc. Users will not be able to submit new jobs until the update completes. Running jobs will be unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this outage or you experience issues following this outage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SLURM Database Outage at 10:00AM on 3/9/23 - UPDATED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/em&gt; The database upgrade is complete. The sacct command will now function as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/em&gt; The database upgrade is taking longer than anticipated. The sacct command will continue to be unavailable as the upgrade progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, March 9th, at 10:00AM, the SLURM database will go offline to undergo an upgrade to the latest software release. The database is expected to be offline for approximately two hours. During this time, the sacct client command will be unavailable for querying job information. Other client commands (e.g. squeue, srun, sbatch, salloc) will continue to work as expected. Jobs may still be submitted and will start normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this outage or you experience issues following this outage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scratch purge of 45 day old files</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting on February 15th, files on /mnt/scratch (/mnt/gs21) that have not been modified within the last 45 days will be deleted. Due to technical issues, this purge has not been running and older files have not been regularly removed from scratch/gs21. This issue has been fixed and automatic deletion will resume on February 15th. Users should ensure that any data older than 45 days on scratch/gs21 that they wish to save has been moved to persistent storage (home/research spaces or external storage.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not impact home directories or research spaces. As a reminder, scratch space is not backed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details can be found on https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Scratch_File_Systems/&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HPCC Scheduled Downtime</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Update 1/5/2023
All updates were completed by 3pm on 1/4/2023.  Globus had problems and was brought back online 1/5/2023.
If you experience any problems, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes include system updates and new kernel “3.10.0-1160.80.1.el7.x86_64” for all compute cluster nodes, gateways, rsync, and globus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HPCC will be unavailable on Wednesday, January 4th for our regularly scheduled maintenance.  No jobs will run during this time. Jobs that will not be completed before January 4th will not begin until after maintenance is complete. For example, if you submit a four day job three days before the maintenance outage, your job will be postponed and will not begin to run until after maintenance is completed.
If you have any questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
