        <title>Password logins to the rsync gateway will be disabled on 10/12/22</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginning on &lt;strong&gt;October 12, 2022&lt;/strong&gt;, ICER will be disabling password authentication to the rsync gateway (rsync.hpcc.msu.edu). In order to improve our operational security, SSH key based authentication will be the only supported method to access the rsync gateway (rsync.hpcc.msu.edu).  Access to login gateways (hpcc.msu.edu) will be unaffected by this change.  For additional information on using SSH key based authentication, please review the documentation at https://docs.icer.msu.edu/SSH_Key-Based_Authentication/.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Scratch gs21 availability and gs18/ls15 retirement - UPDATED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce the general release of our new gs21 scratch system, now available at /mnt/gs21/scratch on all user systems, including gateways, development nodes, and the compute cluster. The new scratch system provides 3 PB of space for researchers and allows us to continue to maintain 50 TB quotas for our growing community. The new system also includes 200 TB of high-speed flash. You may begin to utilize the new scratch system immediately. Please read on for more information about the transition to this space.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 1st, /mnt/scratch and the $SCRATCH variable will be updated to point to the new gs21 space. On July 15th, ls15 and gs18 will be marked read-only, and will be removed from service on July 31st. Please update your scripts or programs that explicitly use gs18 and ls15 to use gs21. If you have a large quantity of data (&amp;gt;10 TB) to move from the old systems to the new, please contact us and we can help you use tools to transfer the data quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the high utilization of gs18 and the age of ls15 and gs18, we are encouraging users to begin migrating to gs21 at their earliest convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to a number of circumstances, the $SCRATCH environment variable will be updated on Friday, July 15, 2022. ls15/gs18 will be marked read-only on July 22, 2022 and removed from service on July 31, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8/31&lt;/strong&gt;: gs18 and ls15 were removed from the compute nodes on July 31st. The systems will be taken completely offline on September 15th. Please contact us if you need help retrieving data from these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Brief Scheduler Outage at 8:00PM 8/18/22 - UPDATED</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, August 18th, at 8:00PM, there will be a brief interruption in scheduling as we push an update to our SLURM configration. We expect this outage to last roughly 30 minutes. During this outage, SLURM client commands will be unavailable (e.g. srun/salloc/sbatch). Running jobs should not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this outage or you experience issues following this outage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to unforseen complications with the configuration update, many running jobs were requeued. Jobs requeued due to this issue have been moved to the top of the queue. We apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HPCC offline - resolved</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The HPCC is currently down due to a hardware failure and a failed failover. We are currently working with NetApp to resolve the issue. Users may have seen issues as soon as 2 PM, and the system has been fully down since about 3:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: At about 5:30PM we’ve cleared the error on the NetApp and are working to restore HPCC services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: As of 7:30 PM services have been restored to service. &lt;a href=&quot;https://contact.icer.msu.edu&quot;&gt;Please let us know if you have any issues.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
