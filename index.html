        </h2>
        <p>UPDATE 11/17/2025 - IPF ran into problems and are not ready to change the diverter on Nov 18.  We are canceling the maintainence reservation and jobs will continue like normal.</p>

<p>The final step needed to repair our water pumps from the 7/9 failure will occur Tues, Nov 18 at 7am and expected to be completed by 5pm.  The primary loop will be diverted back to the main unit.  During that time our main water cooling will be down for the AMD24 and Intel18 clusters.  No jobs will run on the AMD24 and Intel18 clusters during this time.  Jobs that will not be completed before November 18th will not begin until after maintenance is complete. For example, if you submit a four day job three days before the maintenance outage, your job will be postponed and will not begin to run until after maintenance is completed.<br />

        <p>We have have updated scheduler parameters that determine how users’ recent cluster usage affects their FairShare priority factor. Previously, memory usage was weighted higher than CPU usage and GPU usage was not considered. Now, CPU, memory, and GPU usage are all considered in the calculation of FairShare priority and weighted in proportion to the overall availability of those resources.</p>

        <p>RESOLVED: 11/10/2025 8:00AM - The malfunctioning core network infrastructure has been successfully replaced and the ICER network is 100% operational.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 3:00PM - We are working with ITS to install replacement network hardware to return our core network infrastructure to normal operation. Beginning at 6:30AM on Monday, November 10, we will begin bringing services back online using the new network infrastructure. Brief network interruptions may be seen during this time, but should resolve automatically without any outages.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 8:30AM - Impact is resolved.  We identified core network hardware that had failed in a way that prevented High Availability to function properly.  This hardware has been removed from production while we work to get it replaced.  Users shouldn’t notice an impact, but we will be without redundancy on the core network until it is replaced.  ITS is working with the vendor.</p>

<p>HPCC is experiencing network errors causing connection issues.  We are working with ITS networking team on a solution.</p>

        <p>UPDATE: 7/21/2025 - IPF installed a temporary chiller to resume water cooling for our AMD24 cluster.  The cluster is back online and fully functional.  We will need to do a short shutdown to switch to the main chiller after it is fixed, but that could be months down the road.  Will send out annoucements when that happens.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 7/15/2025 - IPF is currently in the process of obtaining a rental water chiller and organizing the water and power feeds.  They are optimistic of having a working solution by end of this week.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 7/11/2025 - The water cooling system is getting too warm and nfh nodes are being shutdown.  IPF and vendor have identified a rental to restore service, timeline for installation still TBD.  Everyone is working hard to get this ASAP.</p>

<p>Starting at 12:30am 7/9/2025, we experienced multiple failed components on our water cooling system.  Waiting on IPF for solutions or alternatives.  We are told it could be multiple weeks for a fix.  We are shutting down AMD24 CPU nodes in hopes the AMD24 GPU nodes will remain in a safe operating temperature.  We will provide updates as we learn more.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>ICER is migrating to a new HPCC home directory system called VAST, an all flash system that will enable fast access to files in your home spaces, and a significantly better working environment overall. Along with the migration, we are increasing the default home space size from 50 GB to 100 GB which will be a hard limit going forward to ensure that usage of home spaces is aligned with their intended purpose (home space documentation). To help accommodate these changes, we are increasing the maximum free research space per principal investigator from 1TB to 3TB. This move toward more research space storage will also enhance collaboration amongst your team.</p>

<p>The process of moving all HPCC home directories to the new VAST system will be spread over time. Starting the week of January 20th, we will start the process of migrating users with less than 100GB of home directory usage to the VAST storage. This will require no HPCC usage during the migration, including scheduled jobs and interactive sessions. We will send users an individual notification ahead of time when their migration is scheduled to start and when their migration starts. Once the move to VAST is complete, they will again be notified and will automatically use the VAST system on their next login.</p>

<p>If you are already using less than 100GB of home space or you can get your usage below this limit before January 15th, you will be among the initial group of users migrated to the VAST system. We will reach out to users above 100GB with further tools and processes later this semester. These users will receive a usage report showing their home directory usage. PIs will also receive team and research group usage.</p>

<p>If you or your team need extra help with this change or want to opt out of the initial migration group, please reach out to the ICER team by opening a ticket in the following website:</p>

The most notable change to the portal following this update will be Globus integration. When browsing files in the updated OnDemand portal, a ‘Globus’ button will be available that will open the current directory inside of Globus. A full list of changes made by this update can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/compare/v3.0.1...v3.1.7">here</a>.

        </h2>
        <p><strong><em>OnDemand:</em></strong> OnDemand is periodically losing connection to our gateway nodes. This makes home and scratch unavailable. We are still investigating the cause. <strong><em>Home directories</em></strong>: The home file system underwent diagnostics from 6/24-6/28. This caused slowdowns for logging in and using the HPCC. We have restarted our backup process after the scan ended 6/28 evening and users may see pauses as the file system catches up. <strong><em>NewOS:</em></strong> We upgraded our operating system to Ubuntu 22.04 in mid June. This included a reinstallation of all software modules. Please read our documentation <a href="https://docs.icer.msu.edu/OS_Upgrade/">here </a>for more details about the upgrade, and <a href="https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact">contact us</a> if you are having issues not covered by this documentation. <strong><em>Please click the title of this post for more detailed information and our planned timeline.</em></strong> <strong>Updated: 7/10</strong> at the end.</p>

        <p>We are aware of two issues affected the system at this time: slow response to commands/slow login, and OnDemand scratch space missing. 
The system slowdowns are caused by diagnostics on the home filesystem as part of our upgrade to a new home filesystem.
We do not currently have an estimate for when these diagnostics will complete. 
The OnDemand scratch space connection is also being diagnosed and addressed with our storage vendor.
Please check back for updates as we have them.</p>

<p>Error message:
“This machine does not meet Visual Studio Code Server’s prerequisites, expected either…:   - find GLIBC &gt;= v2.28.0 (but found v2.17.0 instead) for GNU environments”</p>

<p>Details
Microsoft recently updated Visual Studio Code to version 1.86, and it is no longer compatible with the operating system we use at ICER. The change note that lists the change is here https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_86#_engineering (scroll down to “Linux minimum requirements update”) Although we plan to upgrade our operating system this year, in the meantime there are two solutions to this incompatibility.</p>

<p>Solutions</p>

<p>1) Use our code server app in OnDemand (Interactive Apps -&gt; Code Server (beta)) You can request compute nodes to work on for a specified amount of time, and use VS Code in your browser.</p>

<p>2) Downgrade to the previous 1.85 version of VS Code and disable automatic updates. You can access the previous version here https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_85 (see the Downloads section for a version for your PC or Mac)</p>
