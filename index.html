        <p>Intel14 nodes have been removed from general queues and repurposed. A combined total of 2468 CPU cores and 15.66TB of memory has been dedicated to running jobs submitted through ICER’s installation of <a href="https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Open_OnDemand">Open OnDemand</a>.

        </h2>
        <p>On Thursday, March 30th, at 10:00AM, SLURM clients will be updated to the latest version. This update will bring the node and user components of SLURM to the same version as our SLURM controller and database. Most client commands (e.g. squeue, sbatch, sacct) should work seemlessly through this update. New jobs can be queued as normal and running jobs should not be affected. During these updates, nodes will appear as offline and no new jobs will start. Please note that pending srun/salloc commands may fail to start after this update is complete. If you have a job submitted through srun/salloc that fails after this update, <a href="https://contact.icer.msu.edu/">please contact us</a>. We can boost the priority of your job after resubmission.</p>
