        <p>At about 12:20 PM on October 10th, a bad git merge for our configuration management software caused old configurations to get pushed out to all nodes, which broke a number of services (including the contact forms and job submission on some nodes.)

All nodes and services should be back to normal functionality by 3 PM on October 10th.</p>
